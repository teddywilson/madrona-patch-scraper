# madrona-patch-scraper

This will eventually be useful (for me), but thus far I have put a meager 30 minutes into it.

Basic script to scrape Madrona Labs forums and pull community patches into a local library.

## TODO 
- [ ] Parse all patch types (namely adding json support)
- [ ] Diffing between runs
- [ ] Symlinking/linking to Madrona discovery folder
